      answer: We are <a target="_blank" href="https://www.holistics.io/">Holistics.io</a>, a Singapore-based business intelligence product company. We built dbdiagram internally in order to have a quick way to visualize database schemas for our customers. We thought it would be cool to turn that into a standalone product for the broader data community to use! # FAQ answer 2
