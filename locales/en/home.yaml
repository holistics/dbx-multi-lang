    who:
      question: Who are you guys? And why did you guys build this?
      answer: We are <a target="_blank" href="https://www.holistics.io/">Holistics.io</a>, a Singapore-based business intelligence product company. We built dbdiagram internally in order to have a quick way to visualize database schemas for our customers. We thought it would be cool to turn that into a standalone product for the broader data community to use!
    bugs:
      question: How do I report a bug or request a feature?
      answer: You can post to our <a class="underline" target="_blank" href="https://community.dbdiagram.io/">Community Forum</a>, we get instant notification on every post submit. Alternatively, you can submit the <a class="underline" target="_blank" href="https://form.jotform.com/200914527435049">Feedback Form</a>.
    dsl:
      question: What markup language is the dbdiagram DSL following?
      answer: We use <a class="underline" href="https://dbml.dbdiagram.io/home" target="_blank">DBML - Database Markup Language</a>, a markup language designed to easily document database structures. In fact DBML is born out of dbdiagram! We turned dbdiagram DSL into DBML and made it available for everyone. <br> <br>DBML is also completely open-source on <a class="underline" href="https://github.com/holistics/dbml" target="_blank">Github</a>.
